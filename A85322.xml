            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>The occaſion, or reaſon of her demanding, or his writing of this Rule, is mentioned by the R: F: Lucas Wadding, in the 1. Tome of his Annals on the yeare of our Lord 1224 and 9. of Honorius the Third.</p>

                  <p>This is commonly called the firſt Rule of S. Clare, not becauſe it was giuen firſt, for it was deliuered rather in the third place, and ſoe receiued by S. Clare; but it is called the firſt, by reaſon of fiue different

Monaſterie of S.

                  <p>The 5. Rule is that <note place="margin">The 5. Rule.</note> of Vrban the 4. who cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Pope, 6. yeares only after Jnnocent the 4. being informed, the firſt yeare of his Popedome, by the Cardinal Protector of the Friar-Minors, that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:150047:11"/>
the Religious woemen of the Order of S. Clare, made differently their Profeſſion and Vow, in diuers Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, according to different Rules and formes of life, iudged it expedient to make a new Rule; collecting out of others, ſuch things, as ſeemed moſt conuenient for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and ſtate of thoſe Nunnes; endeauoring, as neer as might be, to reduce them to Vniformitie; and himſelf confirmed this ſaid Rule, by Apoſtolical autoritie, as may be ſeen in Marcus de Liſbona, in the 2. part of his Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and 2. book.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:150047:11"/>
Hence it appeareth that of all theſe 5. Rules here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and at different times deliuered to the Religious woemen of the Order of S. Clare, two only remaine in obſeruance and vſe, to witt, this latter, drawn in order and deliuered by Vrban the 4. cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vſualy the 2. Rule of S. Clare, or of the Urbaniſts; and that other, which was written by S. Francis, as we haue ſayd and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed ſome few days before the death of the Glorious Virgin S. Clare, the 11. yeare of Pope Jn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent the 4. and is know'n vſualy by the name of her firſt
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:150047:12"/>
of her firſt Rule, as wel in reſpect of that of Vrban the 4. which was ordered and brought into a forme of Rule, 6. yeares after her death, as of the 3. others, which, euen at that time, were either anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated, or annulled.</p>
                  <p>Here needeth noe further addition by way of Preface, vnto this firſt Rule of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Mother S. Clare; ſeeing that the following Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Declarations lately approued and confirmed by his Holineſſe Pope Alexander the 7. doe ſufficiently, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their title, declare and explicate what might
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:150047:12"/>
ſeeme obſcure and hidden in the text of the Rule.</p>
                  <p>This J only add, by way of note, that, as in all other, ſoe in this Holy Religious Order of S. Clare, ſuch reſpect and reuerence is due vnto the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Rule, and Author therof, as each word and letter is euer to remaine without change, and inuiolable in its primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue and firſt integritie; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Conſtitutions or Declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the ſame, muſt needs admitt ſometimes va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie and change, according to the change and circumſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of time, place and perſons, eſpeacialy, when vniformitie
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:150047:13"/>
and reference to the ſacred Canons, and Holy Councill of Trent ſhal ſoe require.</p>
                  <p>Hence it followeth that a law may be made voide, that is, by it ſelf, or by authoritie of higher power, may ceaſe to oblige; and yet, that ſame law or Rule ſhal remaine as it was firſt written, and without the change of one only letter; although in practice, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come voide, out of vſe and with out force; as appeareth manifeſt in this very Rule of S. Clare, wherof we treate.</p>
                  <p>And to giue you ſome few inſtances and examples: we find in the beginning of the 2.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:150047:13"/>
chapt: that there is mention <hi>of not admitting Nouices, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conſent and licence of the Lord Cardinal Protector;</hi> which, ſeeing in practiſe, it can not be complyed withall, by reaſon of diſtance of place, and other inconueniences, the leaue of the ſuperiour, or Biſhop of the Dioceſe doth ſuffice; and yet the words, or text of the Rule remaine intire, as they were firſt written, becauſe once they had their effect and force, though they be voide at preſent. Againe, in the end of the 3. chapt: <hi>it is lawfull for the Chaplain to celebrate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Monaſterie, for commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating</hi>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:150047:14"/>
                     <hi>of the ſick,</hi> and yet, for many important reaſons, it hath been iudged needfull to alter it; ordering that Maſſe be celebrated without the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſterie, and that afterwards, the ſick within, if needfull, may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated. Thirdly in the 8. chapt: it is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that <hi>ſome ſecular Perſons may enter the Monaſterie to viſit the ſick,</hi> which now, is expreſly forbidden by the H: Council of Trent in the 25. ſeſſion and 5. chapt: that none enter, but with ſuch reſtrained conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s as are there ſpecified. Laſtly, to omitt diuers other ſuch like inſtances and examples, which
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:150047:14"/>
in this Holy Rule occurre fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, J wil only mention one more, which by miſ-vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, might proue a ſtu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-block, in ſome ons way, if not fore-ſeen in time, and maturely preuented.</p>
                  <p>Jt is ſpecified, in the 1. chapt of the Rule, that, <hi>as S. Clare, in the beginning of her conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, with her ſiſters promiſed obedience to the moſt Holy Father S. Francis, ſoe in like ſort, doth ſhe prcmiſe to obſerue the ſame obedience inuiolably vnto his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours, and the other ſiſters are alwais obliged to obey the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours of H: S. Francis.</hi> Theſe words are wrightly to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:150047:15"/>
not as written by the pen of the ſeraphical Father, [as appeares euident; for, he would neuer haue caled, or giuen him ſelf the title of the <hi>H: and moſt H: Father S. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis]</hi> but litterally, of thoſe Monaſteries, or Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uents only, which, by authoritie and leaue of the ſea Apoſtolique, are immediatly ſubiect to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the Friar-Minors; and not of thoſe, which by their owne requeſt, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his Holineſſe the Pope of Rome, or immediatly by them ſelues, are ſubiected to the gouernment and Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Biſhops of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:150047:15"/>
Dioceſſes: for, theſe rendring their dutie, and obedience to their Ordinarie, neither can, nor may, any ways, ſubmitt themſelues, to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the ſucceſſours of S. Francis.</p>
                  <p>And if we make reflection on the eminent high dignitie of a Biſhop in his Dioceſe, and the esteeme wee ought to haue of his ſoe ſingular and choice title of Ordinarie, we ſhal find, it doth import noe leſſe, then a Juriſdiction and power deliuered vnto him, both by the natural and writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> law of God: for God, hath ſoe diſpoſed in nature, that the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:150047:16"/>
members of a body be ſubiect vnto the head, and particular perſons to the cheef of the Communitie. ſeeing therfore all Chriſtians are members of that particular Church of Chriſt, in whoſe Dioceſe they are, of which Church the Biſhop is head and cheef; it followeth, that as members and parts of the ſame Church, they reuerence and obey him, as placed by God, for their head and guide; according to that ſaying of S. Cyprian <hi>It is eſtabliſhed by Gods</hi>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:150047:17"/>
                     <hi>Biſhop to rule the Church of God,</hi> vnleſſe by an extraordinarie and ſpeacial priuiledge of the ſupreme Uicaire of Chriſt, they ſhould chance to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from this his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie Juriſdiction and power, which the Popes of Rome haue been ſoe farr from gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that euen the contrarie hath been at ſeueral times by them declared, in different and expreſſe Bulls, as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion required.</p>
                  <p>Which truth wil appeare more euident, if we reflect how the order of Friar-Minors eſpeacially in time of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralate of S. Bonauenture,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:150047:18"/>
procured of the Popes Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, an act, wherby he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared them to be exempt and wholy free, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all charge and care of the ſaid religious woemen. Hence it followed, that the Friar-Minors would by noe means admitt, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that they had any power, or Juriſdiction ouer the ſaid Religious of S. Clare, but abſolutely refuſed to come neer their Monaſteries, or to adminiſter the H: Sacraments vnto them, vnleſſe the ſiſters had firſt aſſured them, by a publique Jnſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in writing, that their aſſiſting them, was out of Charitie, and not out
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:150047:18"/>
of obligation of dutie.</p>
                  <p>Hence F: Emmanuel Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dericus, a graue and learned Authour of the ſaid Order, in his 3. tome of Regular que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions 72. queſt: 1. Artic. 3. Conclus: plainly deliuered his opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and iudgment, in point of the Friars hauing charge of Monaſteries of Woemen, in theſe words, as followeth. <q>
                        <hi>I wiſh,</hi> ſaith he, that all Nunnes, of what Regular Jn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute ſoeuer, were ſubiect to the Ordinarie, eſpecially in our Religion of Friar-Minors, in which, we can not take care, of their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions and rents, as others
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:150047:19"/>
may.</q> And the ſeraphical Father S. Francis him ſelf, doth in this point abundantly declare his intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in thoſe his words cited by F: Wadding, in his Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles, on the yeare of our Lord 1219. <q>S. Francis, ſaith he, intending his iourney vnto the Sultan in the Eaſt, the Cardinal Protector Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goline conferred with him, concerning the care and gouernment of the poore Dames of S. Damian and other Monaſteries, which began to be multiplied. The H: Father replyed, that for his part, beſid's that Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:150047:19"/>
only, in which he had encloſed ſiſter Clare, he neither had built, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured any to be built, and ſoe, had taken care of none, but of that only of S. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian, in order vnto Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar diſcipline; prouiding them ſome poore temporal means, by begging for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. He added further, that nothing did ſoe much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe him, as that his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in other parts, earneſtly endeauoured to haue houſes built for Religious Woeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and to haue them vnder their gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and charge.</q> S. Francis, it's true, neuer
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:150047:20"/>
omitted to performe this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable dutie, towards the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſterie of S. Damian, wherin S. Clare was incloſed, as F: Wadding wel noteth, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth further,<q> that this his example gaue exteriourly occaſion vnto his Brethren, to aſſiſt other Monaſteries, who either by perſuaſion, or entreatie, did ſoe intrude the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues into thoſe buſineſſes, that when the ſecret miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheef broke forth a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſhewed it ſelf [as it hapned to their owne great domage, vnder Urban the 4.] they could not withdraw in time, and ſhunne the inconueniences
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:150047:20"/>
that inſued.</q> F: Wadding in the ſame place, hath much more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning this ſubiect, which for diuers reaſons, J purpoſely omitt.</p>
                  <p>Jt followeth cleerly, by what hath been ſayd, that neither S. Francis, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of this H. Rule, euer intended to ſubiect theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Woemen, vnder the Obedience of his Order, [but rather the contrarie] nor that the Order euer accepted, but rather oppoſed and ſhaked off this great charge and burden; wheras, notwithſtanding, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance on both ſid's is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to make a contract
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:150047:21"/>
valid in Law, as all Doctors vnanimouſly doe profeſſe and teach: ſoe that, as Malderus wel noteth, lib. de Jure et Juſtitia: tract: 1. cap: 9. dub: 10.<q> Although it were certaine, ſaith he, and the caſe ſuſppoſed as true, that S. Francis, and S. Clare had made a contract, one with the other, ſhe, in the name of her ſiſters, promiſing Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and he in the name of his Brothers, to haue a perpetual care of the ſiſters, that by this means, they might the better obſerue their ſublime Pouertie; yet, becauſe his ſucceſſours did
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:150047:21"/>
not fulfill and keep this his promiſe, as we haue ſeene in the time of S. Bonauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for this reaſon, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of S. Clare, hath long ſince ceaſed to oblige the ſiſters of theſe ages.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither muſt this ſeeme ſtrange vnto any: for the obligation of keeping a Law, doth ceaſe, ſaith Malderus, in the place afore-mentioned, when the occaſion, or cauſe for which the law was made, doth ceaſe: but the occaſion, or reaſon why S. Clare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Obedience vnto S. Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis and his ſucceſſours, was her earneſt deſire of moſt
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:150047:22"/>
ſublime Pouertie ioyn'd with a ſtrict incloſure, which ſhe knew fullwell, could not be effected nor hoped for, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out aſſiſtance and releef, by the begging of S. Francis and his Brethren for them; but the Friar-Minors after the departure of the ſaint, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely refuſing this charge and burden, and procuring more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer a declaration from his Holineſſe Pope Urban the 4. <q>that they were to be exempt and wholy free from all care of the ſaid Religious Woemen, and by noe obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation bound to vndergoe it;</q> it followeth by way of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:150047:22"/>
conſequence, that the ſaid ſiſters are in noe ways obliged to what ſoeuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tract, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe S. Clare might chance to haue made in their behalf; ſeeing, that both the occaſion, or cauſe, why ſhe might haue made that promiſe, doth ceaſe, and the ſucceſſours of S. Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis haue refuſed to accept the condition, and vndergoe the burden.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, J conclude, that although all that can be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, were ſuppoſed and granted, yet, as all Doctors vnanimouſly affirme, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ceaſeth to oblige, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an higher ſuperiour by lawfull
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:150047:23"/>
autoritie doth releaſe it; and his Holineſſe the Pope of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, can releaſe promiſes made euen to God him ſelf, as is manifeſt: but different Popes, and in particular, Jnnocent the 4. by his Bull here annexed, beginning, <hi>Recto aſſumpto tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite,</hi> hath not only releaſed the ſaid Friar-Minors from all ſuperioritie, charge and care, which here-to-fore they migth pretend to haue had, ouer the Religious Woemen of the order of S. Clare, but doth alſo in Uertue of H: Obedience, ſtrictly comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and enioyne vnder paine of Excommunication, all and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:150047:23"/>
euery one of the Order of Friar-Minors, that he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce forth, they exerciſe noe Juriſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whatſoeuer, ouer the aforeſaid Abbeſſes, Nunnes, or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries of S. Clare, <hi>ſeeing that abſolutly they haue none.</hi> Hence it followeth, that ſeeing the Friar-Minors haue noe Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction or power, ouer the Religious Woemen of the Order of S. Clare, that the ſaid ſiſters alſoe haue noe obligation of Obedience, or ſubiection towards the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd ſuperiours, or Prelats of the Order of Friar-Minors.</p>
                  <p>And to deſcend more to particulars, in the yeare of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:150047:24"/>
our Lord 1631. his Holineſſe Pope Urban the 8. was gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly pleaſed, to ſend a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Breue, to the Abbeſſe a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Religious of the order of S.

                        <hi>Of the Obligation of the Rule and their ſubiection to the Ordinarie.</hi> J. CHAPT.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. WHeras, in the very beginning and other places of the Rule, it is often mentioned, that the Rule, or
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:150047:89"/>
forme of life, of the Order of the poore Siſters, which the Glorious Father S. Francis hath inſtituted, doth conſiſt in the obſeruing and keeping of the holy Ghoſpel of our Lord JESUS CHRIST; they may demand, how farr forth, they bind themſelues to the obſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the holy Ghoſpel, by force of their Vow, made at their Profeſſion; wherin they promiſe to obſerue the forme of life, which is their Rule it ſelf. To this doubt we anſwere them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably to what hath been declared, by ſundry Popes, namely by Nicolas the third
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:150047:89"/>
and Clement the firſt, when their reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were required by the Friar-Minors, in the like doubts, aryſing out of their Rule: to witt, that the Siſters by force of Vow, made in their Profeſſion, obliging themſelues to the obſeruance of the forme of life, doe noe otherwiſe bind themſelues to the keeping of the Ghoſpel, then other Chriſtians; that is, precepts are to bee obſerued as precepts, counſels as counſels; thoſe counſels ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, which in their forme of life, are expreſſed, or doe import the name of precepts. To other counſels, they are
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:150047:90"/>
only obliged after the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie manner of other Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; ſauing only, they endeuour to goe beyond the perfection of the ordinarie ſtraine of Chriſtians; hauing freely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoted themſelues to Chriſt, by their Profeſſion, which may iuſtly require a more ſtrict following of his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A like doubt may ariſe, how the Obligation of the Rule vnder mortal ſinne, is to bee vnderſtood. Wher-vnto we anſwere briefly, with Pope Eugenius the 4. to witt, that the Rule containes noe other precepts, then the Uow's of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:150047:90"/>
Obedience, Pouertie, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie, Encloſure, Depoſition and Election of the Abbeſs.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. For as much as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Obedience due to their immediate, or higheſt ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours; it is to bee noted, that although in the firſt chapter of S. Clare's Rule, mention is made of Obedience, which the Siſters are to yeald to the ſuperiours of the Order, in theſe words. <hi>And as in the beginning of her conuerſion, ſhe with her Siſters, promiſed Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to S. Francis: ſoe, in like manner, doth ſhe promiſe to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the like Obedience inuiola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to all his ſucceſſours; and the</hi>
                        <pb n="180" facs="tcp:150047:91"/>
                        <hi>other Siſters are alwayes bound to obey the ſucceſſours of S. Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis.</hi> Yet theſe words are ſoe to be vnderſtood, that they expreſſe her Obedience, in thoſe her beginnings, to S. Francis and his ſucceſſours, by way only, of reſpect and deuotion towards him, from whom ſhe receiued her H: Rule. But in proceſſe of time, different Monaſteries of S. Clare, haue, for iuſt reaſons, humbly requeſted, of the Sea Apoſtolique, an exemption from the Order: the which, the ſaid Sea, was graciouſly pleaſed to grant them; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting them by Bull, to the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:150047:91"/>
Obedience of the Ordinarie, or Biſhop of the Dioceſe wher they reſide; as appeareth namely, in the Bull of Pope Jnnocent the fourth, beginn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Recto aſſumpto tramite:</hi> the which original is yet extant in the Conuent of the Friar-Minors at Paris. And the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſterie of poore Clares at Graueling, hath by eſpecial grant of Pope Urban the 8. of happie memorie, obtained an exemption from the Order, and a ſubiection to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie the Lord Biſhop of S.

                     <p n="4">4.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and will, vnto that of the Superiour, who commandeth. The third is, Obedience by vnion, wherby the true obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient man, hath no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, then the pleaſure and will of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Euangelical Pouertie hath three degrees. The firſt is Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie by Profeſſion; that is, to haue no proprietie, or right to any thing whatſoeuer. The ſecond, to retaine the ſimple vſe only of things neceſſarie, and reſt content with the moſt vile. The third, not to haue any

affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, euen in things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie; but by way of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtraint, to take the bare vſe of them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Chaſtitie, is a vertue, that hath three degrees. The firſt is Chaſtitie of body, by which all the exteriour members are reſtrained from any impure, or ſuſpicious act. The ſecond, Chaſtitie of heart, by which the heart is preſerued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any diſhoneſt, or vncleane thought. The third, chaſtitie of ſpirit, by which, we not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any diſhoneſt loue, but alſo from all exceſſiue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectation in ſpiritual co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forts.</p>

The third is, humilitie of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, wherwith a ſoule doth not only humble her ſelf in the ſight of God, but of men alſo; deſyring to be by them eſteemed poore and abiect.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Simplicitie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taineth three degrees. The firſt is, ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of thoughts, eſteeming ones ſelf the moſt vnworthy

of all creatures to ſerue God, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d nouriſhing a belief of ones vnfittneſs to honours and worldly dignities. The ſecond is ſimplicitie of words, auoyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all affected curioſitie and ſuperfluitie in ſpeach, which proceed from an ill roote of vanitie. The third is ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of work's, employing our ſelues in thoſe only, which are ſimple and profitable, yet ſoe, as prudence muſt euer accompanie this ſimplicitie: for God loueth thoſe, that walk in prudence, with a pure, right, and ſimple intention.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Charitie is a vertue of three decrees. The firſt is, to
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:150047:163"/>
loue God not only for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, but alſo, for that he is moſt worthy of our loue. The ſecond is, to loue our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, not only for loue of him, but ſimply for the loue of God. The third is, to loue our ſelues in labouring for vertue, glory, and eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, not for our owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, but to pleaſe God, and for loue of his diuine Maieſtie.</p>

<pb n="352" facs="tcp:150047:178"/>
before, when yet we were in captiuitie and vanitie of the world. For after his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſion [not hauing as yet, any bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers] being to repaire to S. Damians Church, where he was viſited with diuine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations, and conſtrained wholy to abandon the world; filled with ioy and illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Holy Ghoſt, he propheſy'd of vs, that which our Lord hath afterwards ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</p>
                  <p>For ſtanding on the walls of the ſayd Church, he called with a lowd voice in the Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſh tongue, on ſome poore folks, who liued ther about, ſaying:

And not only of vs did our Holy Father foretell theſe things, but alſo of thoſe, who hereafter ſhal be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Uocation which our Lord hath called vs vnto. With what care of ſoule and

                  <p>Seeing then our Lord God hath honoured vs with ſoe high a Vocation, as to ſerue for paterne vnto thoſe, who
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:150047:179"/>
ought to be an example vnto others, how much are we bound to bleſs, and priſe our Lord God, and in well doing to remaine the more comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him. Wherfore, if we liue piouſly, according to the forme aboue mentioned, we ſhal leaue good example vnto thoſe, who ſhal follow vs, and after ſhort labours, receiue the reward of euerlaſting life. When our heauenly Father had vouchſafed, through his great mercie and grace, to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate my heart, in ſuch ſort, that through the example and teaching of our holy Father S. Francis, J began to doe pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:150047:180"/>
a little after his con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerſion; J, with a few Siſters whom our Lord ioyned vnto me, a little after my conuer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſion, willingly promiſed vnto him Obedience, as our Lord, through the light of his grace, inſpired vs, by meanes of his maruelous life, and holy do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
                  <p>S.

<pb n="357" facs="tcp:150047:180"/>
example of his Brothers, he reioyced in our Lord; and moued with great charitie towards vs, obliged him ſelf, and his Brothers to haue alwais ouer vs a ſpecial and diligent care. We went alſo by the will of God, and of our Holy Father S. Francis towards the Church of S. Damian, to dwell ther. Soone after which time, our Lord, through his great mercy and grace, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed vs in number, ſoe that then was fulfilled that, which our Lord had ſayd by his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant; for we dwelt before in an other place.</p>
                  <p>A little after, he wrote vnto
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:150047:181"/>
vs, this forme of life, and principally, that we ſhould perſeuer in this moſt holy po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie. Neither was it ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent vnto him, that he admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed vs ther vnto in his life, by many ſermons and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to moue vs to the loue and obſeruance of the ſame holy pouertie: but alſo he gaue vs many writings, that after his death we might not fall fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame holy Pouertie, but loue it, according to the example of the Sonne of God, who liuing in this world, did neuer leaue the ſayd pouertie: which alſo our holy Father S.

<pb n="359" facs="tcp:150047:181"/>
and obſerue, during his life.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore, J Clare, ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and hand-mayd of Chriſt, and of the poore Siſters of S. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian, although vnworthy, the little plant of our holy Father S.

<pb n="360" facs="tcp:150047:182"/>
may by noe means, decline from it.</p>
                  <p>This pouertie, J have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wais been carefull [with the grace of God] to obſerue, and to cauſe it to be obſerued, and for more ſecuritie, J haue made Profeſſion ther-of vnto our Holy Father Pope Jnno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent the fourth, in whoſe time we began, and haue renewed it to his ſucceſſours, that by no meanes, and in no time, we ſhould decline from this holy Pouertie, which we haue vowed vnto God, and to S. Francis.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore, J bowing the knees both of my body and
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:150047:182"/>
ſoule in all humilitie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend vnto the Church of Rome, vnto our Holy Father the Pope, and eſpecialy vnto the Cardinal, vnto whoſe Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, togeather with the Friar-Minors, we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, that for the loue of God, who was borne in great pouertie, layd in the Crib, and liued poorly in this world, and dyed poorly on the Croſſe, they wil preſerue this litle flock, which God the Father hath gayned to his Church, by the words and examples of our holy Father S.

                  <p>And as God gaue vnto vs, our holy Father S. Francis, for our founder and helper in the ſeruiſe of God, and in thoſe things, which we vowed vnto God, and vnto him to obſerue; and as he was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full whiles he liued, to water vs his litle plants, by word and example: ſoe J commend and leaue my Siſters, as wel thoſe who are alreadie, as thoſe
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:150047:183"/>
who hereafter ſhal be, vnto the ſucceſſour of S.

Jf it ſhal happen at any time, that the ſaid Siſters ſhould leaue their Contry or Cittie, to goe to an other, they are firmly bound after my death, in what place ſoeuer they are, to obſerue the holy Pouertie which they haue vowed vnto God, and vnto S. Francis.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who ſhal be in office, as alſo the other Siſters, ſhal be carefull, that they receiue
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:150047:184"/>
no more ground, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> extreme neceſſitie doth require; as a garden for help vnto their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief: and if for the defence, or decencie of the Cloyſter, it were needfull to haue more ground, they ſhal take but only what is neceſſarie: in which they may not plough, or ſow. J admoniſh you all, my Siſters, who are, and ſhal be, that you labour to follow the way of ſimplicitie, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, and pouertie; and alſo the modeſtie of holy Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation; as we in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of our conuerſion, were tought of Chriſt, and of our holy Father S. Francis.
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:150047:184"/>
Soe that, not through our merits, but through the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the liberal giuer, the Father of mercies may ſpread abroad the odour of our good naem, as wel amongſt thoſe, who are far of, as amongſt thoſe, who are neer.</p>
                  <p>And for the Charitie of our Lord JESUS, keep vnion of loue. The Charitie which you haue inwardly, ſhew it out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly by work's, to the end, that through your example, the Siſters, which are called vnto your Profeſſion, may increaſe in the loue of God, and mutual Charitie.</p>
                  <p>Alſo J pray all thoſe, who
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:150047:185"/>
ſhal be choſe to beare offices among the Siſters, that they wil ſtudie to excell the others, rather in vertue, and modeſt conuerſation, then in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and office that ſo, by their example, the Siſters which were called vnto Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion before them, may be moued to obey them, not only in reſpect of their office but for loue.</p>
                  <p>The Abbeſs muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and diſcreet towards her Siſters, as a good Mother is towards her childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. She muſt carefully prouide for euery one, according to their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, of the almes, which
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:150047:185"/>
it ſhal pleaſe God to ſend her. She muſt alſo be ſo ſweet and familiar vnto all, that the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters may without feare, or doubt, declare vnto her their neceſſities, and haue confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently recourſe vnto her.</p>
                  <p>When the Abbeſs and the Siſters ſhal think anything ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, lett the Siſters, which are ſubiect, remember, that for the loue of God, they haue renounced their owne wills: wherefore, J wil, that they obey their Mother, as they haue of their owne accord vowed vnto God to doe; to the end that their Mother, ſeeing the humilitie, chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:150047:186"/>
and vnion, which they haue vnto each other, may eaſily beare the charge, which ſhe hath by her office. Which becauſe it is heauy and bitter; they muſt, through their holy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſation, ſeek to turn into ſweetneſs. And ſeeing the way is narrow, and the gate ſtrait, which leadeth vnto life, and few their are which walk in it and few that perſeuer therin, bleſſed are thoſe, which haue receiued the grace to walk in it, and to perſeuer therin vnto the end.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore, lett vs be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, ſeing we be entred in to the way of our Lord, that by
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:150047:186"/>
our fault and negligence, we doe not fall from the ſame, commit, or doe iniurie vnto our Lord, vnto his Bleſſed Mother the Glorious Uirgin Marie, vnto our holy Father S.

                  </p>
                  <p>To obtaine this grace, J bow my knees vnto the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father, through the merits of our Lord JESUS, and of his B. Mother, of our H. Father S. Francis, and of all the Saints, that it wil pleaſe his diuine Maieſtie, who hath
